## 0.3.0 - 22 Oct 2024

Breaking changes:
* [#1339][]: ladslog: Drop `HandlerOptions` in favor of `HandlerOption`,
  which uses the functional options pattern.
* [#1339][]: ladslog: Rename `AddSource` option to `WithCaller`.

Enhancements:
* [#1339][]: ladslog: Record stack traces for error logs or higher.
  The new `AddStackAt` option changes this level.

Bug fixes:

  and omitting groups with no attributes.
